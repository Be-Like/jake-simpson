    <p>
      I love software development and enjoy learning new technologies. I often
      tell people that if I could make a living being a full time student, I
      would do so in a heartbeat. I guess that is why I enjoy technology - 
      software in particular - so much; it changes frequently and requires me 
      to constantly be learning.
