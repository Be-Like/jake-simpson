    <p>
      Dart and Flutter are both developed by Google and allow for the 
      development of native, cross-platform applications while writing and 
      maintaining a (mostly) single code base. Unlike most of the competitors,
      Flutter was developed for this purpose; which makes it more performant 
      and easier to learn. Because Flutter controls every pixel, it makes it a
      perfect tool for complete customization.
