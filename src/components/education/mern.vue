      While studying at USC, I discovered that I have a passion for learning.
      My desire for discovery and knowledge of how things work led me to seek
      scholarship in an industry that will never quench that passion.
      Technology! In an industry that is ever in motion, I am always thrilled
      to learn about and to be a part of the new and emerging tech. This is
      what led me to seek and acquire a degree in Computer Science.
